## 👨‍💻 What I Do  
I explore and build across **cybersecurity, OSINT, system security, and automation**.  
My interests fall into three major buckets:

- **Security Engineering**  
  Writing scripts, small tools, and utilities that support recon, enumeration, and analysis.

- **OSINT & Recon**  
  Researching footprinting techniques, metadata extraction, web recon and building my own recon framework.

- **Software & Automation**  
  Building practical projects using Python, Java, web technologies, and APIs.

I prefer creating tools that solve real problems instead of theoretical projects.

## 🛠️ Projects & Work  
Here are the projects that represent my current skill set:

### 🔥 **TheWildEye — Recon & OSINT Framework**  
A unified reconnaissance framework with modules for OSINT, metadata extraction, URL/SSL analysis, WP enumeration, directory discovery, etc.  
Built from scratch for practical red-team style recon.

### 🐅 **TigerHunt — Directory Buster**  
Multithreaded dirbuster with clean output, status categorization, redirect handling, and live progress tracking.

### 🧾 **TigerCrawler (Email + Link Discovery)**  
Multithreaded web crawler for enumerating emails, validating formats, extracting domain-wide links, and avoiding admin/login noise.

### 🌐 **Java Weather Forecasting App**  
Servlet-based web app using OpenWeatherMap API + JDBC + MySQL.

### 🎬 **Freelance Creative Work (S8UL Esports)**  
Video editing & motion graphics for national-level gaming creators.  
Developed strong experience in **workflow automation**, **media pipeline management**, and **brand content optimization**.
